Over the last few days the hashtag **#7FaveGames** has been trending on
twitter. As you can probably guess you're supposed to list your top seven games of
all time and put them out to the world to be judged!

Of course, I jumped straight into this trend and submitted my own choices - if
you're interested, my faves are in the banner of this post.

Whilst trawling my gaming history to narrow down the choices, I started to
wonder about the most popular games overall. A great excuse to
pull out the R analytics toolkit and do some amateur data science.

## Gathering all those Tweets

The first step was to gather as many **#7FaveGames** tweets as
possible without crossing the boundaries set by the twitter API (180
requests per 15 minutes).

I decided to store all tweets and their metadata in a CSV file. This
makes the data much easier to explore and reload - specifically for
the numerous cases where I accidently trashed the in-memory copy.

### Initialize CSV Store

Initially we want to set some batch parameters and pull the first
batch. This first chunk is used to create the CSV file to which we
will append during the rest of the process.

{% highlight r %}
# define batch size
batch <- 500
sleepPeriod <- 10

# pull first batch and initialize output file
tweets <- searchTwitter("#7FaveGames", n=batch, retryOnRateLimit=batch)
parsed <- do.call("rbind.fill", lapply(tweets, as.data.frame))
write.table(parsed, file="7favegames.csv", sep=",", append=TRUE, col.names=TRUE)
{% endhighlight %}

### Grab the Rest of the Data

Next we just paginate, in descending chronological order, through
the rest of the data using the **maxID** key to shift the query
window. The last id in the current batch is used as the maxID in the
next to ensure a contiguous set of tweets.

We just keep looping through until we hit a batch smaller than
expected, or a NA id.

Admittedly it's a pretty basic approach, but it does the job *... in a
couple of hours ...*

{% highlight r %}
# while we still have tweets to read, pull batches
# (with respect to twitter so I don't get kicked)
pull <- TRUE
while (pull) {
  # grab the last id of the previous batch
  id <- parsed$id[batch]
  print(c("Getting batch with id ", id))
  
  # perform a paginated search on twitter
  tweets <- searchTwitter("#7FaveGames", n=batch+1, retryOnRateLimit=batch, maxID=id)
  parsed <- do.call("rbind.fill", lapply(tweets, as.data.frame))

  # strip the first record to avoid duplicates, as it was the last in the previous batch
  parsed <- parsed[-(1:1),]
  write.table(parsed, file="7favegames.csv", sep=",", append=TRUE, col.names=FALSE)
  pull <- (nrow(parsed) > 1) || (!is.na(id))

  # just pause for a moment to avoid hammering the twitter api
  # TBH the 'retryOnRateLimit' would probably do the job better anyway
  Sys.sleep(sleepPeriod)
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Building a Word Cloud

### Which Libraries?

First to import a bunch of libraries we need.

* **tm** and **SnowballC** for text mining and transformation
* **RColorBrewer** to pick a color palette
* **wordcloud** to plot the cloud itself

{% highlight r %}
library(tm)
library(SnowballC)
library(wordcloud)
library(RColorBrewer)
{% endhighlight %}

### Change Encoding

We read in the data we collected in the last step. For some unknown reason the
data is coming back in an odd
encoding. We need to force it to UTF-8 to avoid the "tc" algorithms
crashing out half-way through.

{% highlight r %}
data <- read.csv("7favegames.csv", row.names=NULL, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
tweets <- data$text
tweets <- enc2utf8(tweets)
{% endhighlight %}

### Convert "Odd" Characters and Numbers

Many of the video game titles include roman numerals (e.g. Final
Fantasy X) or accented characters (e.g. Pokémon). We want to simplify
these down to a common form so we don't end up with duplicates
(Pokémon vs Pokemon).

The roman numeral converter is pretty primitive but, I think, fine for this
purpose. *The odd ordering of the numbers is so that we're greedy in
our matching of independent roman numerals (i.e. we don't match a
substring of a numeral and corrupt the value).*

{% highlight r %}

replaceRoman <- function(vect) {
  numerals <- c("xviii", "xvii", "xiii", "viii", "xiv", "xvi", "xix", "vii", "iii", "xii", "ii", "iv", "vi", "ix", "xi", "xv", "xx", "i", "v", "x")
  numbers <- c(18, 17, 13, 8, 14, 16, 19, 7, 3, 12, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15, 20, 1, 5, 10)
  for (i in c(1:length(numerals))) {
    vect <- gsub(paste("\\b", numerals[i], "\\b", sep=""), numbers[i], vect)
    vect <- gsub(paste("\\b", toupper(numerals[i]), "\\b", sep=""), numbers[i], vect)
  }
  return(vect)
}

tweets <- replaceRoman(tweets)
# remove accented characters
tweets <- iconv(tweets, to='ASCII//TRANSLIT')
{% endhighlight %}

### Perform Corpus Transformations

This is where the bulk of the transformations occur. We first create a
text corpus from our tweets and ...

* Convert to lower case
* Remove any punctuation
* Remove stop words, such as **"the"** and **"and"**. Or those specific to tweets(**"rt"** and **"lol"**), and video games (e.g. **"super"** to avoid common words in all those SNES games).

{% highlight r %}
corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(tweets))
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(tolower))
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, PlainTextDocument)
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, removePunctuation)
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, removeWords, c("7favegames", "amp", "rt", "lol", "follow", "twitter", "series", "new", "super", stopwords("english")))
{% endhighlight %}

### Plot Word Cloud

Finally, now that we have our simplified corpus, we can plot our word
cloud.

We choose a solid color scheme, avoiding too many of the weaker
colors that would be hard to read. You can see the full selection of palettes by running *display.brewer.all()*

{% highlight r %}
# plot word cloud
pal <- brewer.pal(8,"Dark2")
wordcloud(corpus, max.words = 200, random.order=TRUE, scale=c(5, .5), colors = pal)
{% endhighlight %}
